#### Friday, April 17

I wont' bother you with lunch because it was the remaining lamb soup and the pork and chives dumplings from Dumpling House. But we've been busy on the side with mini-madeleine with a lemon glaze.  The spectacular bump is the result of placing the madeleine mold on a heavy steel cookie sheet so the bottom gets lots of heat.

Deb made some banana bread, something she hasn't done in a long while.

And I've been happily eating almond croissants filled with home-made almond cream (and on top to made the sliced almonds adhere). This is delicious with the most mediocre store-bought croissants so it's a great discovery.

**Dinner**: Deb had been wanting poached salmon for a while and finally got some at Whole Foods on Prospect St. She sous-vided it at 125 degrees and it was unacceptably mushy; was it the fish or the prep?  We're still trying to figure it out but it was most likely improperly stored salmon. We had it with a cauliflower gratin.

**Lunch**: A little more lamb soup left over from the other night so we enriched it with some of the Easter lamb; better than the original soup!

**Dinner**: Deb was persuaded to make a run to H-Mart so we could have rice-cracker crusted tuna with spicy citrus sauce, something which was once in regular rotation but had been neglected for a long while. Deb had bought enough tuna for 4 servings which we didn't mind.

**Lunch**: We'd expected to have the hamachi Deb bought as a second course after the tuna last night but we were sated. So here it is for lunch as hamachi poke with ikura.

**Dinner**: As usual, Tomasz joined us and we put him to work making the corned beef hash practially single-handedly. Although I was alert enough to picture him photographing the corned beef and onions when they were ready to be combined, I forgot to take the photos of our actual dinner! (You'll see it later as leftovers!)

**Lunch**: We thought that the final leftover Easter lamb would be too little for both of us but happily it was just fine. As we never fail to do, we made J-G's roasted lamb sandwich with roasted pepper and basil mayo, but this time had it on the marvelous focaccia Deb has been mastering.

**Dinner**: It continued to be Jean-George day as we tried his Asian version of steak tartare (his name: Raw Beef!) with five condiments: lemongrass, mint, cilantro, chili sauce and ground toasted glutinous rice. The chili sauce and the rice were both big hits; the rice provided a tasty crunch to everything it touched.

Since there was practially no cooking involved with the beef, I made some flatbread to go with it.

**Lunch**: Deb finished off making the tomato soup she started yesterday and it was just as fabulous as we'd hoped (it's a bunch of work as the canned tomatoes have to be roasted to become flavorful enough). Of course, homemade croutons as usual.

I fried up the remainder of the flatbread dough which was just right for sopping up the soup.

**Dinner**: At wasn't hard to convince Deb that she wanted to stop by Alive n' Kickin' to pick up some lobster so that we could make Jean-George's Lobster Summer Roll, a rather intense take on the Vietnamese specialty. That most time-consuming aspect was the gel√©e of lemongrass shown here as the roll was being constructed. Then the other ingredients: bean sprouts, carrots, vermacelli, etc.

Accompanied by a spicy Sirracha mayonnaise.

**Lunch**: Back to the freezer for the last portions of spanakopita.

**Cocktail Hour**: Here is a typical selection of things we munch on with our cocktails (70% of the time Jean-George's Ginger Margarita): pistachios, roquefort and yorkshire cheeses, chips for the homemade boursin in the middle, ikura, chips, shaved aged gouda, and amazing lemon-flavored peanuts we found in Costa Rica.

**Dinner**: With the second lobster from yesterday, Deb made her wonderful lobster risotto with clam juice and chives.

**Coffee Break**: We've discovered that Amazon carries a superb imported tuscan cantucci, the almond biscotti served with espresso in Tuscany.

![Cantucci:40](img5/Cantucci.jpg)

**Lunch**: The big repeat! More tomato soup and flatbread. I'm becoming enamoured of having fresh, hot bread slathered with butter with my soup!

**Dinner**: Deb was finally able to get a duck from Savenor's but it was sufficiently frozen that we decided not to struggle with it and have instead the hanger steak she also brought home along with the cauliflower gratin. Fries too of course!
