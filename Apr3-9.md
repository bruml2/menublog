#### Friday, April 3

We were so pleased with our first focaccia (although it was too tall), we wanted to make another right away, this time in two quarter-sheet pans instead of one. The dough was much wetter than the first time leading us to think perhaps some measurement was off but the outcome looked fine (just very hard to remove from the pan in spite of all the EVOO).

**Lunch**: We made mortadella sandwiches and prosciutto and mozzarella panini with the focaccia.

And finished off the last (sadly) of the terrific French Onion Soup.

**Dinner**: Happily, Savenor's was able to fill our order for hanger steak; sadly they didn't have any duck and had no idea when they would. Deb made the beets and goat cheese from Spago in LA (easy with an egg slicer) and we made two batches of onion rings (the lighter for Deb because she couldn't taste the onion in the others).
