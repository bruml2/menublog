      <p><b>Motivation</b>:
        We're all stuck indoors these days. For us, this means a chance to be more ambitious about what we eat which, in turn, means getting to cook out of those cookbooks which have been too-long ignored. We're particularly anxious to explore James Peterson's <i>Glorious French Food</i>, Joanne Chang's <i>Meyers & Chang At Home</i>, and Dorie Greenspan's <i>Around My French Table</i>.</p>

<h4 id="friday-april-17">Friday, April 17</h4>
<p>I wont&#39; bother you with lunch because it was the remaining lamb soup and the pork and chives dumplings from Dumpling House. But we&#39;ve been busy on the side with mini-madeleine with a lemon glaze.  The spectacular bump is the result of placing the madeleine mold on a heavy steel cookie sheet so the bottom gets lots of heat.</p>

<div class='pic'><img src="img5/LemonMiniMadeleineB.jpg" alt="Mini-Madeleine with bump" style="width:40%"></div>
<p>Deb made some banana bread, something she hasn&#39;t done in a long while.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/BananaBread.jpg" alt="Banana Bread" style="width:60%"></div>
<p>And I&#39;ve been happily eating almond croissants filled with home-made almond cream (and on top to made the sliced almonds adhere). This is delicious with the most mediocre store-bought croissants so it&#39;s a great discovery.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/AlmondCroissantC.jpg" alt="Almond Croissant" style="width:70%"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: Deb had been wanting poached salmon for a while and finally got some at Whole Foods on Prospect St. She sous-vided it at 125 degrees and it was unacceptably mushy; was it the fish or the prep?  We&#39;re still trying to figure it out but it was most likely improperly stored salmon. We had it with a cauliflower gratin.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/SalmonCauliflower.jpg" alt="Salmon with Cauliflower Gratin" style="width:80%"></div>
<h4 id="saturday-april-18">Saturday, April 18</h4>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong>: A little more lamb soup left over from the other night so we enriched it with some of the Easter lamb; better than the original soup!</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/SoupEasterLamb.jpg" alt="Lamb Soup with Easter Lamb" style="width:60%"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: Deb was persuaded to make a run to H-Mart so we could have rice-cracker crusted tuna with spicy citrus sauce, something which was once in regular rotation but had been neglected for a long while. Deb had bought enough tuna for 4 servings which we didn&#39;t mind.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/RiceCrackerTuna.jpg" alt="Rice-cracker-crusted Tuna" style="width:60%"></div>
<h4 id="sunday-april-19">Sunday, April 19</h4>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong>: We&#39;d expected to have the hamachi Deb bought as a second course after the tuna last night but we were sated. So here it is for lunch as hamachi poke with ikura.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/HamachiPoke.jpg" alt="Hamachi Poke" style="width:70%"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: As usual, Tomasz joined us and we put him to work making the corned beef hash practially single-handedly. Although I was alert enough to picture him photographing the corned beef and onions when they were ready to be combined, I forgot to take the photos of our actual dinner! (You&#39;ll see it later as leftovers!)</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/TomaszHash.jpg" alt="Tomasz and Corned Beef Hash" style="width:45%"></div>
<h4 id="monday-april-20">Monday, April 20</h4>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong>: We thought that the final leftover Easter lamb would be too little for both of us but happily it was just fine. As we never fail to do, we made J-G&#39;s roasted lamb sandwich with roasted pepper and basil mayo, but this time had it on the marvelous focaccia Deb has been mastering.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/OpenLambSandwich.jpg" alt="Lamb Sandwich Prep" style="width:70%"></div>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/LambSandFocaccia.jpg" alt="Lamb on Focaccia" style="width:60%"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: It continued to be Jean-George day as we tried his Asian version of steak tartare (his name: Raw Beef!) with five condiments: lemongrass, mint, cilantro, chili sauce and ground toasted glutinous rice. The chili sauce and the rice were both big hits; the rice provided a tasty crunch to everything it touched.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/Condiments.jpg" alt="Condiments" style="width:35%"></div>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/RawBeefChiliSauce.jpg" alt="Raw Beef" style="width:70%"></div>
<p>Since there was practially no cooking involved with the beef, I made some flatbread to go with it.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/FlatbreadA.jpg" alt="Flatbread" style="width:60%"></div>
<h4 id="tuesday-april-21">Tuesday, April 21</h4>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong>: Deb finished off making the tomato soup she started yesterday and it was just as fabulous as we&#39;d hoped (it&#39;s a bunch of work as the canned tomatoes have to be roasted to become flavorful enough). Of course, homemade croutons as usual.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/TomatoSoup.jpg" alt="Tomato Soup" style="width:65%"></div>
<p>I fried up the remainder of the flatbread dough which was just right for sopping up the soup.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/FlatbreadB.jpg" alt="Flatbread" style="width:70%"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: At wasn&#39;t hard to convince Deb that she wanted to stop by Alive n&#39; Kickin&#39; to pick up some lobster so that we could make Jean-George&#39;s Lobster Summer Roll, a rather intense take on the Vietnamese specialty. That most time-consuming aspect was the gel√©e of lemongrass shown here as the roll was being constructed. Then the other ingredients: bean sprouts, carrots, vermacelli, etc.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/SummerRollA.jpg" alt="Summer Roll One" style="width:70%"></div>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/SummerRollB.jpg" alt="Summer Roll Two" style="width:65%"></div>

<div class='pic'><img src="img5/SummerRollD.jpg" alt="Summer Roll Four" style="width:40%"></div>
<p>Accompanied by a spicy Sirracha mayonnaise.</p>
<h4 id="wednesday-april-22">Wednesday, April 22</h4>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong>: Back to the freezer for the last portions of spanakopita.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/SpanakopitaApr22.jpg" alt="Spanakopita" style="width:45%"></div>
<p><strong>Cocktail Hour</strong>: Here is a typical selection of things we munch on with our cocktails (70% of the time Jean-George&#39;s Ginger Margarita): pistachios, roquefort and yorkshire cheeses, chips for the homemade boursin in the middle, ikura, chips, shaved aged gouda, and amazing lemon-flavored peanuts we found in Costa Rica.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/CocktailSnacks.jpg" alt="Cocktail Snacks" style="width:70%"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: With the second lobster from yesterday, Deb made her wonderful lobster risotto with clam juice and chives.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/LobsterRisotto.jpg" alt="Lobster Risotto" style="width:60%"></div>
<h4 id="thursday-april-23">Thursday, April 23</h4>
<p><strong>Coffee Break</strong>: We&#39;ve discovered that Amazon carries a superb imported tuscan cantucci, the almond biscotti served with espresso in Tuscany.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/Cantucci.jpg" alt="Cantucci" style="width:40%"></div>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong>: The big repeat! More tomato soup and flatbread. I&#39;m becoming enamoured of having fresh, hot bread slathered with butter with my soup!</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/TomatoSoupApr23.jpg" alt="Tomato Soup" style="width:60%"></div>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/FlatbreadApr23.jpg" alt="Flatbread" style="width:55%"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: Deb was finally able to get a duck from Savenor&#39;s but it was sufficiently frozen that we decided not to struggle with it and have instead the hanger steak she also brought home along with the cauliflower gratin. Fries too of course!</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img5/HangerSteakApr23.jpg" alt="Hanger Steak" style="width:70%"></div>
