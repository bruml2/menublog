<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>We&#39;re all stuck indoors these days. For us, this means a chance to be more ambitious about what we eat which, in turn, means getting to cook out of those cookbooks which have been too-long ignored. We&#39;re particularly anxious to explore James Peterson&#39;s <em>Glorious French Food</em>, Joanna Chang&#39;s <em>Meyers &amp; Chang At Home</em>, and Dorie Greenspan&#39;s <em>Around My French Table</em>.</p>
<p><em>Posts are in reverse chronological order!</em></p>
<h3 id="monday-march-23">Monday, March 23</h3>
<p>Back to normal weekday breakfasts which consist of two toasted slices of Iggy&#39;s Francese with Jalapeno Peanut Butter and Trader Joe&#39;s Concord Grape Jam, both of which I&#39;m addicted to. Which helps get me out of bed in the morning!</p>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong>: Deb walked to Central Square this morning and (following some persuasion) picked up some tuna and ikura at H-Mart so we could make tuna tartare as we remember it from George, the restaurant in the Pompidou Center in Paris. The dressing is EVOO, Maggi, Red Boat Fish Sauce, and sesame oil and the garnish is crème fraîche and chives.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/TunaTartare.jpg" alt="Tuna Tartare" style="width:80%"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: An expansive dinner following a cocktail hour which featured Albert Stockli&#39;s Chicken Liver Paté; unfortunately, I didn&#39;t photograph it so the left-overs will appear tomorrow.</p>
<p>We did our usual pollo al mattone using the 15 pound Thai mortor as the &quot;brick&quot;.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/PolloOnStove.jpg" alt="Pollo under the Brick" style="width:80%"></div>
<p>It was not as deeply browned as usual and it&#39;s not clear why. Perhaps it didn&#39;t have enough time drying out in the refrigerator prior to being cooked. Still, very satisfying.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/PolloAlMattone.jpg" alt="Pollo al Mattone"></div>
<p>With that we had side servings of potatoes L&#39;Ami Louis (the famous bistro in Paris; that last time we were there following an opera performance who walked in but the conductor Seiji Ozawa).</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/PotatoesLamiLouis.jpg" alt="Potatoes L&#39;Ami Louis" style="width:80%"></div>
<p>And finally, some baked feta.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/BakedFeta.jpg" alt="Baked Feta" style="width:70%"></div>
<h3 id="sunday-march-22">Sunday, March 22</h3>
<p><strong>Breakfast</strong>: Deb had some english muffins and I had two egg yolks so we converged on eggs Benedict with prosciutto substituting for the Canadian bacon.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/EggsBenedict.jpg" alt="Eggs Benedict"></div>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong>: We waited until mid-afternoon to think about lunch so wanted only a little.  We keep some cooked shrimp in the freezer for such occasions but instead of our usual shrimp cocktail I wanted to be more ambitious. A definite mistake in this instance. We tried to make shrimp toast from the <em>Gourmet Cookbook</em> with some lovely brioche we had left-over from french toast. Big mistake: the very open crumb absorbed lots of frying oil and cooked very quickly; the shrimp paste didn&#39;t stick to the toast. Other than that . . .</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/ShrimpToast.jpg" alt="Shrimp Toast" style="width:70%"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: We made Dorie&#39;s <em>Chicken Liver Gâteaux with Pickled Onions</em> but it didn&#39;t come cleanly out of the ramekins. Also Deb assumed I would add the cognac; I assumed she had. Nonetheless, tasty enough.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/ChickenLiverGateau.jpg" alt="Chicken Liver Gateaux"></div>
<p>Tomasz was with us for the usual Sunday evening catching up. He reported that he was comfortably installed in a large suite in Adams House but that the dining services had been passing out bags of the same lunch and the same dinner for the past seven days! With cocktails we had our favorite mini-madeleines from Dorie:</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/MiniMadeleinesB.jpg" alt="Mini-Madeleines"></div>
<p>We then put Tomasz to work to make Bucatini Putanesca for the main course.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/BucatiniPutanesca.jpg" alt="Bucatini Putanesca"></div>
<h3 id="saturday-march-21">Saturday, March 21</h3>
<p><strong>Breakfast</strong>: We look forward to weekend breakfasts which always include Deb&#39;s superior, completely-rendered and therefore very crisp bacon.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/SatBacon.jpg" alt="Saturday&#39;s Bacon"></div>
<p>For decades the standard Saturday morning breakfast has included a &quot;German Pancake&quot; which is the sole recipe I cook from my mother. It&#39;s also called a &quot;Dutch Baby&quot;, particularly when decked out with some sauteéd apples. I had great difficulty with it recently until I learned that the batter must not be cold going into the oven; since then, everything is back to normal.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/SatPancake.jpg" alt="German Pancake"></div>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong>: We made an impromptu stir-fry with the left-over scallops from the risotto. Not very photogenic!</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/StirfryScallops.jpg" alt="Stirfried Scallops"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: One of our favorite meals: magret with salad! Deb has just purchased a new screen to cover the frying pan while sauteéing the duck; no more grease all over the stove!</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/MagretWithScreen.jpg" alt="Magret with Screen"></div>
<p>The end result:</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/MagretWithSalad.jpg" alt="Magret with Salad"></div>
<p>along with some left-over cauliflower:</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/CauliflowerLeftovers.jpg" alt="Cauliflower" style="width:70%"></div>
<p>I&#39;ve been taking the trouble to render the duck fat from the duck carcasses which provides not only lots of duck fat for confiting the legs but also these wonderful cracklings.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/DuckCracklings.jpg" alt="Duck Cracklings" style="width:70%"></div>
<h3 id="friday-march-20">Friday, March 20</h3>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong>: We had an impromptu scallop risotto last night (to use up some terrific frozen bay scallops from Mexico). Deb didn&#39;t like the scallops (ask her!) but, as usual, we had left-over risotto. So for lunch Deb made arancini.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/Arancini.jpg" alt="Arancini"></div>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong>: It had been a very long time since we had one of our favorite ways to prepare fish: blackening. This was a tremendous fad back in the eighties and has mostly disappeared but we love it, especially with swordfish and bluefish. It could not be simpler: cover room-temperature fish heavily on both sides with Chef Paul&#39;s Redfish Magic, place in a scortchingly hot cast-iron pan for a total of 10 minutes per inch of thickness [the famous &quot;Canadian fish rule&quot; which holds for any cooking method], and sauce with some brown butter.</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/BlackenedSwordfish.jpg" alt="Blackened Swordfish"></div>
<p>Deb made a shaved fennel salad from Peterson with shavings of parmigiano (Peterson admits that it&#39;s more Italian than French).</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/ShavedFennel.jpg" alt="Shaved Fennel Salad"></div>
<p>And I finally after years of procrastination made the Îles Flottantes from Dorie&#39;s book which calls for baking the meringues rather that the usual poaching in milk. She said to fancy it up with chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce so we did!</p>
<div class='pic'><img src="img/FloatingIsland.jpg" alt="Floating Island"></div>
<p>I had the left-over floating island the next day and did a much better job of photographing it.</p>
