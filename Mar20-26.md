### Motivation

We're all stuck indoors too much of the time these days. For us, this means a chance to be more ambitious about what we eat which, in turn, means getting to cook out of those cookbooks which have been waiting for us to get serious. We're particularly anxious to explore James Peterson's _Glorious French Food_, Joanna Chang's _Meyers & Chang At Home_, and Dorie Greenspan's _Around My French Table_.

_Posts are in reverse chronological order!_

### Sunday, March 22

**Breakfast**: Deb had some english muffins and I had two egg yolks so we converged on eggs Benedict with prosciutto substituting for the Canadian bacon.

**Lunch**: We waited until mid-afternoon to think about lunch so wanted only a little.  We keep some cooked shrimp in the freezer for such occasions but instead of our usual shrimp cocktail I wanted to be more ambitious. A definite mistake in this instance. We tried to make shrimp toast from the _Gourmet Cookbook_ with some lovely brioche we had left-over from french toast. Big mistake: the very open crumb absorbed lots of frying oil and cooked very quickly; the shrimp paste didn't stick to the toast. Other than that . . .

**Dinner**: We made Dorie's _Chicken Liver Gâteaux with Pickled Onions_ but it didn't come cleanly out of the ramekins. Also Deb assumed I would add the cognac; I assumed she had. Nonetheless, tasty enough.

Tomasz was with us for the usual Sunday evening catching up. He reported that he was comfortably installed in a large suite in Adams House but that the dining services had been passing out bags of the same lunch and the same dinner for the past seven days! With cocktails we had our favorite mini-madeleines from Dorie:

We then put Tomasz to work to make Bucatini Putanesca for the main course.

### Saturday, March 21

**Breakfast**: We look forward to weekend breakfasts which always include Deb's superior, completely-rendered and therefore very crisp bacon.

For decades the standard Saturday morning breakfast has included a "German Pancake" which is the sole recipe I cook from my mother. It's also called a "Dutch Baby", particularly when decked out with some sauteéd apples. I had great difficulty with it recently until I learned that the batter must not be cold going into the oven; since then, everything is back to normal.

**Lunch**: We made an impromptu stir-fry with the left-over scallops from the risotto. Not very photogenic!

**Dinner**: One of our favorite meals: magret with salad! Deb has just purchased a new screen to cover the frying pan while sauteéing the duck; no more grease all over the stove!

The end result:

along with some left-over cauliflower:

I've been taking the trouble to render the duck fat from the duck carcasses which provides not only lots of duck fat for confiting the legs but also these wonderful cracklings.

### Friday, March 20

**Lunch**: We had an impromptu scallop risotto last night (to use up some terrific frozen bay scallops from Mexico). Deb didn't like the scallops (ask her!) but, as usual, we had left-over risotto. So for lunch Deb made arancini.

**Dinner**: It had been a very long time since we had one of our favorite ways to prepare fish: blackening. This was a tremendous fad back in the eighties and has mostly disappeared but we love it, especially with swordfish and bluefish. It could not be simpler: cover room-temperature fish heavily on both sides with Chef Paul's Redfish Magic, place in a scortchingly hot cast-iron pan for a total of 10 minutes per inch of thickness [the famous "Canadian fish rule" which holds for any cooking method], and sauce with some brown butter.

Deb made a shaved fennel salad from Peterson with shavings of parmigiano (Peterson admits that it's more Italian than French).

And I finally after years of procrastination made the Îles Flottantes from Dorie's book which calls for baking the meringues rather that the usual poaching in milk. She said to fancy it up with chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce so we did!

I had the left-over floating island the next day and did a much better job of photographing it.
