**Lunch**:  Starting off the week with a bang! Some more of Deb's wonderful Cream of Tomato Soup. More bang! The remainder of last night's hanger steak and the final bit of the leftover Mac and Cheese.

**Dinner**: We were impressed with an anchovy pasta recipe in the Times but it turned out to be mediocre; the only saving grace was the sausage I added.

**Lunch**: When we don't have anything obvious on hand we resort to the freezer with its supply of our homemade Mama Chang's dumplings.

**Dinner**: We were finally more than ready for that duck which wouldn't thaw quickly enough. We tried James Patterson's recipe for blueberry sauce (_The Duck Cookbook_) but with raspberries; it was a hit!

**Breakfast**: We wanted a special treat this morning so had buttermilk waffles with pecans:

**Lunch**: The tomato soup Deb made was such a hit that she decided to try the same formula for a beet soup. Sure enough, it was terrific, especially with the crème fraîche.

**Dinner**: Tomasz has been learning about pasta preparations so we put him to work making penne al'arabiatta.

**Lunch**: We somehow never tire of having corned beef hash on hand. This almost finished it off.

**Dinner**: That whole beef tenderloin we cut up a while ago is now history. The fries will be back soon!

**Lunch**: We were quite happy to see that beet soup back on the table accompanied by my new fav, the flatbread you saw earlier.

**Special**!  Deb was so impressed that her friend who doesn't cook had made no-knead bread successfully that she wanted to try it herself. In particular, she wanted to make rye bread so I clamored for the inclusion of caraway seeds.

**Dinner**: If there's a duck in the house, it won't be long before Deb makes the duck ragu from _Lupa_ and I make pappardelle.

**Lunch**: Back to the freezer for another package of our homemade Mama Chang's dumplings.

**Dinner**: Sorry to say that I must have left the camera's SD card in the iMac so the photos I thought I was taking of the terrific rack of lamb we'd cooked sous vide (129 degrees) in the vacuum-sealed package straight from Trader Joe's do not exist.

**Lunch**: Deb went shopping again and brought back more pastromi so we could repeat our favorite Reuben sandwich which we could now have on her rye bread. I was so excited that I didn't remember to take the picture until it was almost gone!

**Dinner**: Since this was shopping day, Deb brought back some lovely salmon which I decided to sear. The fried shallots on top are my latest fixation (close behind the flatbread, which we now have daily). _Cook's Illustrated_ described a method of frying the shallots in the microwave; it works well but they keep cooking after being removed so get quite dark.
